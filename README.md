## Odin Recipes: Take Two, Electric Boogaloo
This project is a basic recipe site, themed to some of my favorite fictional characters. It has an index page and links to three "recipes."

Upon completion of this project, I will have demonstrated specific HTML skills. The skills demonstrated are:

- creating pages
- linking to other pages
- inserting images in pages
- creating ordered and unordered lists

> I do not own any of the fictional characters mentioned. This is just for funsies :relieved:
