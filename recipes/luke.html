        <p>Introducing my sunshine, my pookie, my light in the dark.</p>
        <p>When I first saw Luke and his sunshine yellow color scheme, I couldn't help but smile.</p>
        <p>When I found out he was a detective who loved photography and fixing old antiques, my heart melted. </p>
        <p>When I found out his golden retriever personality was hiding something darker, something more complex,
         I felt seen.</p>
        <p>The more I learned about his story and his struggles, the more I loved him. His light is so bright despite how
            bleak things get, and it's so admirable. As his story developed, we grew <i>together,</i> and his hope gives me hope.</p>
