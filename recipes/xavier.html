        <p>My cuddly bunny, my twin starlight, my eternal reminder that self-love isn't selfish.</p>
        <p>Xavier has so many motifs that I love and adore, but I confess that I almost quit this game on day one.</p>
        <p>When I realized that we share the same birthday, I decided to stay, and I'm glad I did.</p>
        <p>Xavier is so unashamed in his love for us that it makes me want to treat myself better. It reminds me that I deserve
        more than the bare minimum, that I deserve a happy ending as much as anyone else. His story is one of a devotion that defies
         fate, that <i>changes</i> fate.</p>
        
        <p>On the surface, Xavier is the eepy, sleepy star prince who just wants to cuddle and eat warm food,
            but beneath that is an immortal man who wants to grow old with you, to make it to the end of the story,
            to live happily ever after, with <i>you</i>.</p>
        <p>Here's how to make a star will shine only for <i>you</i> in every timeline:</p>
