        <p>Meet my little paradox, my little trickster, my first star.</p>
        <p>When we were first introduced to him, his moveset was a mystery. It <i>stayed</i> a mystery for the entirety of the first season,
            but I felt in my heart of hearts that he was meant to be a star boy.</p>
        <p>When he unveiled his greatest trick, I don't think anyone was more excited than I was to see his Meteor Drive.</p>
        <p>I love everything about him, from his <i>puri's</i> to his <i>pupiina's</i>. He's such a sweetheart, and I'm glad that
        he's finally chosen himself.</p>

       <p>Here's how to make the star boy that's always ten steps ahead of his captive audience:</p>
